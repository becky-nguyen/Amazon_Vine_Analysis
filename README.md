# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. In this program, companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review on the products. This analysis is specifically looking at video games.

* 11.18% of Vine reviews were 5 stars.
* .88% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars. 

## Summary
In our results above, we can see that there is a higher percentage of of five star reviews found in the vine reviews compared to the non-Vine reviews. This suggests that there may be a positive bias in the reviews in the Vine program. It is good to note that our population for Vine reviews is much smaller compared to non-Vine reviews (94 to 40471). It's also good to consider that Vine customers were required to write a review. Regular non-Vine customers may be less inclined to write a review unless they are emotionally charged (example: upset over their purchase). 

To further our analysis, it would be good to increase the population of our Vine program customers to give a better comparison. Also, we should consider the genre of the game. If all the Vine reviews are reviewing the same type of game, that could be a factor in the review ratings.
